# initial version of data structures.
# Degree of a nodes is total number of trees from that nodes.
# Leaf --> if a node does not have a child node, than it will be leaf node.
# Degree of tree is max degree of the nodes in the tree.
# Level in a tree starts at 0.
# Height or depth is the max number of node in a branch.
# path is called as sequence of consicutive edges.
# A binary tree is tree where any node can not have more than 2 nodes. Highest possible degree of any node can be 2. If it recursive. 
# A complete binary tree is tree where every level is filled, in other terms all the leafs are at the same level.
